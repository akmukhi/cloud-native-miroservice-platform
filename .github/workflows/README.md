## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Manual Deployment to Production

1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select **"Deploy to Production"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Choose options:
   - **Force deploy**: Skip tests (not recommended)
   - **Rollback**: Rollback to previous version
   - **Version**: Specific version to deploy

### Emergency Rollback

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select **"Emergency Rollback"** workflow
3. Choose:
   - **Environment**: dev/staging/production
   - **Version**: Leave empty for previous version

### Infrastructure Changes

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select **"Terraform Infrastructure Deployment"**
3. Choose:
   - **Environment**: dev/staging/prod
   - **Action**: plan/apply/destroy

## üîí Security Features

### Automated Security Scans
- **Dependency scanning** with OWASP Dependency Check
- **Container scanning** with Trivy and Snyk
- **Code analysis** with GitHub CodeQL
- **Secrets detection** with TruffleHog and GitGuardian
- **Compliance checking** with Checkov

### Security Gates
- All deployments require security scans to pass
- High-severity vulnerabilities block deployments
- Secrets are automatically detected and flagged
- Compliance violations are reported

## üìä Monitoring and Notifications

### Slack Notifications
- Deployment status updates
- Security scan results
- Infrastructure changes
- Error alerts

### GitHub Notifications
- Deployment records in GitHub
- Security scan results in Security tab
- PR comments with scan results

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. GCP Authentication Failed
```bash
# Check service account permissions
gcloud auth list
gcloud config get-value project

# Verify service account has required roles:
# - Cloud Run Admin
# - Cloud Build Editor
# - Secret Manager Secret Accessor
# - Cloud SQL Client
```

#### 2. Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check database status
gcloud sql instances describe watch-notify-postgres

# Verify connection from Cloud Run
gcloud run services describe watch-notification-service-dev
```

#### 3. Build Failures
```bash
# Check build logs
gcloud builds list --limit=10

# Verify Docker build locally
cd backend
docker build -t test .
```

#### 4. Deployment Failures
```bash
# Check Cloud Run service status
gcloud run services describe watch-notification-service-dev

# View service logs
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision"
```

### Debug Commands

#### Check Workflow Status
```bash
# View recent workflow runs
gh run list --limit 10

# View specific workflow logs
gh run view <run-id>
```

#### Manual Rollback
```bash
# List Cloud Run revisions
gcloud run revisions list --service=watch-notification-service-prod

# Rollback to specific revision
gcloud run services update-traffic watch-notification-service-prod \
  --to-revisions=REVISION_NAME=100
```

## üìà Best Practices

### 1. Branch Strategy
- **`main`**: Production-ready code
- **`develop`**: Integration branch
- **`feature/*`**: Feature development
- **`hotfix/*`**: Emergency fixes

### 2. Deployment Strategy
- **Development**: Fast feedback, frequent deployments
- **Staging**: Full testing, production-like environment
- **Production**: Manual approval, comprehensive validation

### 3. Security Practices
- Never commit secrets to code
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Regular security scanning
- Principle of least privilege

### 4. Monitoring
- Health checks after deployment
- Performance monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Resource utilization

## üîß Customization

### Environment-Specific Configurations

#### Development
```yaml
# Lower resource limits
cloud_run_cpu: "1000m"
cloud_run_memory: "512Mi"
cloud_run_max_scale: 5
cloud_run_min_scale: 0
```

#### Production
```yaml
# Higher resource limits
cloud_run_cpu: "2000m"
cloud_run_memory: "2Gi"
cloud_run_max_scale: 20
cloud_run_min_scale: 1
```

### Custom Notifications

Add custom notification channels:
```yaml
- name: Custom notification
  uses: your-custom-action@v1
  with:
    webhook_url: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_WEBHOOK }}
    message: "Custom deployment notification"
```
